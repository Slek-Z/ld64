Tiny x64 Length Disassembler

Inspired form: https://github.com/greenbender/lend

The length disassembler is written in C, but a PIC version written in FASM is
provided in [fasm/LD64.ASM](../blob/master/fasm/LD64.ASM).

The complete list of supported instructions is available [here](../blob/master/doc/INSTRUCTIONS).
